                The mission of the IETF is to make the Internet work better by producing high 
                quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, 
                use, and manage the Internet.

            <p>
                The IETF recently held a virtual hackathon. 300 people registered and contributed 
                to 20 different projects. One of the projects "helped encourage awareness of the 
                performance implications of the various QUIC stacks, and the complexities that 
                interop adds to performance."

                ICANN plays a unique role in the infrastructure of the internet. Through its contracts 
                with registries (such as dot-com or dot-info) and registrars (companies that sell 
                domain names to individuals and organisations), we help define how the domain name 
                system functions and expands.

                Feedback on the proposed DSA regulation
            </a>
            <p>
                The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers announced today that on 31 March 
                2021, the ICANN org submitted feedback on the proposed Digital Services Act (DSA) regulation. 
                The DSA is a legislative initiative launched in response to growing concern over the roles 
                and responsibilities of online platforms. Once adopted, it will introduce obligations 
                concerning illegal content that will apply to digital services providers that offer services 
                in Europe, regardless of whether they are established in Europe. The proposal also attempts 
                to clarify the rules for the conditional exemption from liability. Domain Name System (DNS) 
                service providers are in scope.

                This specification defines interfaces to codecs for encoding and decoding of audio and video. 
                This specification does not specify or require any particular codec or method of encoding or 
                decoding. The purpose of this specification is to provide JavaScript interfaces to implementations 
                of existing codec technology developed elsewhere. Implementers may support any combination of codecs 
                or none at all.
