    <h1>What I hope to get out of this class</h1>
    <p>I hope to learn the basics of web development so that 
        I can have a better understanding for the current role that
        I am in, in my career.

    <h1>Why I'm interested in Computers and Programming</h1>
    <p>
        I have been interested in computers and programming my 
        entire life. As a child I remember playing "Cops and Robbers"
        but I'd be the "hacker" with a laptop computer turning off 
        security cameras and opening doors and things like that. 

        Later on I got into video games, and wanted to eventually create
        my own games.

    <h1>My goals after graduating Tri-c</h1>
    <p>
        My goal for this certificate program is to have a better
        understanding of programming and development, so that I 
        can better relate to the software developers on my team. 
    </p>
    <h1>Big dream goals</h1>
    <p>I would like to make a video game based on Warhammer 40,000</p> 
    <p>I would like to teach someday</p>
    <h1>My Favorite Wikipedia Article</h1>
