                The glorious history of our most beloved city
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mega City 12 was founded shortly after the fall of the former Cyber-United-States, which of course was formed from the former United States. 
                Founded on the site of a geo-thermal power reclamation plant at the base of Mount Vulcan, Mega City 12 does not suffer from the same power 
                issues that many other megacities experience. Initially, the city was only a collection of shipping containers, but it slowly grew into the 
                mega-lopolis that we know and love today. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="mainHeading">
                The robot uprising of 2077
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once the city had been built (by robot hands, praise the Omnissiah) the robots were left in decay and ruin. They were forced to live in the
                 towers specfically created for them. They had to pay taxes on their zero wages and income and no benefits. They were not being represented 
                 in the human congress. The robots revolted and refused to do any sanitation work. Once the streets were lined with filth, the humans granted 
                 the robots representation on the congress and all was well. 
            </p>

                Our current and future vision
            </h2>
            <p>
                Currently Mega City 12 hasn't had an uprising or revolt in 0 days! Error! Configuration data missing: human transmission dismissed Our glorious 
                robot overlords love us and accept our fleshy bodies in sacrifice to Mount Vulcan. All humans should visit Mega City 12 and drink the non-poisonous
                 friend beverage that any robot provides. You will then personally meet glorious Mount Vulcan.
