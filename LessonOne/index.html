        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Matt Mahoney. This is my second semester at Tri-C.
            Here you can see a picture of my happy family!

        <h1>What I hope to get out of this class</h1>
        <p>I hope to learn the basics of web development so that 
            I can have a better understanding for the current role that
            I am in, in my career.
        </p>
        <h1>Why I'm interested in Computers and Programming</h1>
        <p>
            I have been interested in computers and programming my 
            entire life. As a child I remember playing "Cops and Robbers"
            but I'd be the "hacker" with a laptop computer turning off 
            security cameras and opening doors and things like that. 

            Later on I got into video games, and wanted to eventually create
            my own games. 
        </p>
        <h1>My goals after graduating Tri-c</h1>
        <p>
            My goal for this certificate program is to have a better
            understanding of programming and development, so that I 
            can better relate to the software developers on my team. 
        </p>
        <h1>Big dream goals</h1>
        <p>I would like to make a video game based on Warhammer 40,000.</p> 
        <p>I would like to teach someday.</p>
